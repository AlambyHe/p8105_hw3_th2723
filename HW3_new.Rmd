```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)
library(tidyverse)
```

###Problem 1
Basic setup:
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
str(instacart)
view(instacart)
```

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?
```{r}
ins_aisles = 
instacart %>%
  count(aisle, name ="number_aisles") %>%
  arrange(desc(number_aisles)) 
```

By using the count command, we can see that fresh vegetables is the most item ordered from. There are 134 aisles(also use length function to check) and the number of fresh vegetables is 150609. 

Scatterplot:
```{r}
ins_aisles%>%
  filter(number_aisles > 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = aisle, x = number_aisles)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5)
```

```{r}
library(tibble)
instacart_pop =
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name, name ="number_product_name") %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) 
instacart_pop %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_product_name)) %>% 
  top_n(3) %>% 
  knitr :: kable()
  
```

A table shows the mean of hour:
```{r}
instacart_mean =
  instacart %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  select(product_name,order_dow,order_hour_of_day) %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples","Coffee Ice Cream")) 
instacart_mean =
  instacart_mean %>% 
  group_by(order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_order_hour_of_day = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  mutate(
    order_dow = recode(order_dow, '0' = "Sunday",'1' = "Monday",'2' = "Tuesday",'3' = "Wednesday", '4' = "Thursday", '5' = "Friday", '6' = "Saturday")
  )
  
view(instacart_mean)
  
  
```


### Problem 2
Basic data cleaning:
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010") 
brfss = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%  #format the data use appropriate variable names
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% #focus on topic
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent","Very good","Good","Fair","Poor")) %>%  # responses from "Excellent" to "Poor", used unique command to check what are categories in response
  mutate(
     response = as.factor(response),
     response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Poor","Fair","Good","Very good","Excellent"))) #responses as a factor taking levels orders

```
For 2002, there are three states were observed at 7 or more locations. They were MA,NJ, and PA.
```{r}
brfss_2002= 
  brfss %>%
  select(year,locationabbr,locationdesc) %>% 
  filter(year == "2002") %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  count(locationabbr, name = "number_of_location") %>% 
  mutate(
    number_of_location = number_of_location/5
  ) %>% 
  filter(number_of_location > 7)
brfss_2002

```
For 2010, there is a significant increase in the number of locations that satisfy our requirements. Specifically, 11 states are obseved at 7 or more locations.
```{r}
brfss_2010= 
  brfss %>%
  select(year,locationabbr,locationdesc) %>% 
  filter(year == "2010") %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  count(locationabbr, name = "number_of_location") %>% 
  mutate(
    number_of_location = number_of_location/5
  ) %>% 
  filter(number_of_location > 7)
brfss_2010
```

A two panel plot for 2006 and 2010:
```{r}
library(patchwork)
Two_2006 =
brfss %>% 
  filter(year == "2006") %>% 
  select(year,locationabbr,response, data_value) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent","Very good","Good","Fair","Poor")) %>% 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY")
Two_2006

Two_2006 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = data_value)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = .5) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  


```


```{r}
Two_2010 =
brfss %>% 
  filter(year == "2010") %>% 
  select(year,locationabbr,response, data_value) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent","Very good","Good","Fair","Poor")) %>% 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = data_value)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = .5) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

  
```
